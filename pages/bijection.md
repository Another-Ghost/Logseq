- 既是[[injection]]又是[[surjection]]的[[映射]]$f$则称为[[bijection]]。
- If there exists a [[1-1 mapping]] of $A$ onto $B$, we say that $A$ and $B$
  can be put in [[1-1 correspondence]], or that $A$ and $B$ have the same [[cardinal number]], or, briefly, that $A$ and $B$ are [[equivalent]], and we write $A\sim B$.
