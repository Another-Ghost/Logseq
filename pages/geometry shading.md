alias:: geometry shader

- The [[geometry shader]] is like the tessellation shader in that it takes in [[primitives]] of various sorts and can **produce new** *vertices*. 
  It is a much simpler stage in that **this creation is limited in scope** and **the types of output *primitives* are much more limited**. 
  *Geometry shaders* have several uses, with one of the most popular being [[particle generation]]. Imagine simulating a fireworks explosion.
