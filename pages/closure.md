- # Definition
  If $X$ is a [[metric space]], if $E\subset X$, and if $E'$ denotes the set of all [[limit points]] of $E$ in $X$, then the [[closure]] of $E$ is the set $\bar{E} = E\cup E'$.
- # Theorem
	- 1.
		- If $X$ is a [[metric space]] and $E\subset X$, then
			- (a) $\bar{E}$ is [[closed]],
			- (b) $E = \bar{E}\Longleftrightarrow$ $E$ is closed,
			- (c) $\bar{E}\subset F$ for every closed set $F\subset X$ such that $E\subset F$.
		- By $(a)$ and $(c)$, $E$ Is the **smallest closed subset** of $X$ that contains $E$.
	- 2. Let $E$ be a **nonempty** set of [[real numbers]] which is [[bounded above]]. Let $y =\mathrm{sup}\ E$ (Then $y\in \bar{E}$). Hence $y\in E$ **if** $E$ is [[closed]].
