alias:: real numbers, real, real-valued, 实数

- # Definition
	- By the [[segment]] $(a, b)$ we mean the set of all [[real numbers]] $x$
	  such that $a< x < b$.
	  By the [[interval]] $[a, b]$ we mean the set of all real numbers $x$ such that
	  $a\le x\le b$.
	- Occasionally we shall also encounter [[half-open intervals]] $[a, b)$ and $(a, b]$;
