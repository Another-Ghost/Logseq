- # Definition 
  The [[extended real number system]] consists of the [[real field]] $R$ and two symbols, $+\infty$ and $-\infty$. We preserve the original [[order]] in $R$, and define 
  $$-\infty<x<+\infty$$
  for every $x\in R$.
- It is then clear that $+\infty$ is an [[upper bound]] of every [[subset]] of the extended real number system, and that $every nonempty subset has a least upper bound$. 
  If, for example, $E$ is a nonempty set of real numbers which is not [[bounded above]] in $R$, then $\mathrm{sup}E = +\infty$ in the extended real number system. 
  Exactly the same remarks apply to [[lower bounds]].
- The extended real number system *does not form a [[field]]*, but it is customary to make the following conventions:
	- (a) If $x$ is real then 
	  $$X +\infty = +\infty, \quad x-\infty=-\infty, \quad \frac{x}{+\infty}=\frac{x}{-\infty}=0$$
	- (b) If $x > 0$ then $x 路 (+\infty) = +\infty, \ x 路 (-\infty) = -\infty$.
	- (c) If $x < 0$ then $x 路 (+\infty) = -\infty,  \ x 路 ( -\infty) = +\infty$.
- When it is desired to make the distinction between [[real numbers]] on the one hand and the symbols +\infty and -\infty on the other quite explicit, the former are called [[finite]].
