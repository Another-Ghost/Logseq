alias:: linearly polarized, monochromatic

- The [[light wave]] is [[linearly polarized]] means that for a *fixed point* in space, the [electric]([[electric field]]) and [[magnetic fields]] each move back and forth along a line.
- In contrast, in rendering we focus on [[unpolarized light]], which is much more prevalent. 
  In [[unpolarized light]] the [[field oscillations]] are **spread equally over all directions perpendicular to the propagation axis**. 
  Despite their simplicity, it is useful to understand the behavior of monochromatic, linearly polarized
  waves, since any light wave can **be factored into a combination** of such waves.
