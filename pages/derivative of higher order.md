- If $f$ has a [[derivative]] $f^\prime$ on an [[interval]], and if $f^\prime$ is itself [[differentiable]], we denote the derivative of $f^\prime$ by $f{''}$ and call $f''$ the [[second derivative]] of $f$.
  Continuing in this manner, we obtain functions
  $$f,f',f'',f^{(3)},\cdots,f^{(n)}$$
  each of which is the derivative of the preceding one. $f^{(n)}$ is called the [[nth derivative]] of $f$.
