alias:: particles

- The intensity of light [[scattered]] from a small [cluster]([[cluster of molecules]]) of $n$ [[molecules]] is $n^2$ times the light scattered from an *individual molecule*, which is $n$ times more light than the same number of molecules would scatter in an [[ideal gas]].
- Making the *clusters* **larger**, while still keeping the overall *molecular density constant*, will further **increase** *scattered light intensity*, until the *cluster diameter* becomes close to a [[light wavelength]]. 
  Beyond that point, additional increases in cluster size will **not further** increase the scattered light intensity.
  > This process explains why [[clouds]] and [[fog]] [[scatter]] light so strongly. They are both
  created by condensation, which is the process of water molecules in the air clumping
  together into increasingly large *clusters*.
- the term [[particles]] is used to refer to both *isolated molecules* and *multi-molecule clusters*.
- They exhibits the same *directional variation* and [[wavelength dependence]].
- This type of scattering is called [[Rayleigh scattering]] in the case of [[atmospheric particles]] and [[Tyndall scattering]] in the case of [[particles embedded in solids]].
- As particle size increases beyond a [[wavelength]], the fact that the scattered waves
  are no longer [[in phase]] over the entire particle changes the characteristics of the scattering, the scattering increasingly **favors** the *forward direction*, and the [[wavelength dependency]] decreases until light of all visible wavelengths is scattered **equally**. This type of scattering is called [[Mie scattering]].
