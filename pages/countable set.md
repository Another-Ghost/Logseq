- # Arranged in a Sequence
	- Since every countable set is the [[range]] of a [[1-1]] function defined on $N$, we may regard every countable set as the range of a [[sequence]] of [[distinct]] **terms**.
		- Speaking more loosely, we may say that the elements of any countable set can be ''arranged in a sequence".
