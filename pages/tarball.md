- In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing), **tar** is a computer software utility for collecting many files into one [archive file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive_file), often referred to as a **tarball**, for [distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_distribution) or backup purposes. The name is derived from "tape archive", as it was originally developed to write data to sequential [I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output) devices with no file system of their own. The archive data sets created by tar contain various [file system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system) parameters, such as name, timestamps, ownership, file-access permissions, and [directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_(computing)) organization.
