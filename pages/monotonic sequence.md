alias:: monotonic

- # Definition
	- A sequence $\{s_n\}$ of [[real numbers]] is said to be
		- [[monotonically increasing]] if $s_n\le s_{n+1} (n = 1, 2, 3, ... )$;
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- [[monotonically decreasing]] if $s_n\ge s_{n+1}(n = 1, 2, 3, ... )$.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- The class of [[monotonic sequences]] consists of the [[increasing sequence]] and the [[decreasing sequence]].
