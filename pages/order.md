alias:: Â∫è, ordered

- # Definition
	- Let $S$ be a [[set]]. An [[order]] on $S$ is a [[relation]], denoted by $<$, with the following two properties:
		- (i) If $x\in S$ and $y\in S$ then one and only one of the statements
		  $$x<y, \quad x=y, \quad y<x$$
		  is true.
		- (ii) If $x, y, z \in S$, if $x < y$ and $y < z$, then $x < z$.
	- The notation $x\leq y$ indicates that $x < y$ or $x = y$, without specifying which
	  of these two is to hold. In other words, $x\leq y$ is the [[negation]] of $x > y$.
