alias:: photons

- a [[photon]] is a *packet* of light that has a [[position]], [[direction of propagation]], and a [[wavelength]] $λ$.
  The [[SI unit]] used for [[wavelength]] is *nanometer* ($\mathrm{nm}$), and $1$ $\mathrm{nm} = 10^{-9} m$.
- A photon also has a [[speed]] $c$ that depends only on the [[refractive index]] $n$ of the *medium* through which it *propagates*.
- Sometimes the [[frequency]] $f = c/λ$ is also used for light. This is convenient because unlike $λ$ and $c$, $f$ **does not change** when the *photon* [[refracts]] into a *medium* with a new r[[efractive index]].
- Another **invariant measure** is the amount of [[energy]] $q$ carried by a [[photon]], which
  is given by the following relationship:
  $$q = hf = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$
  where $h = 6.63 × 10−34 \mathrm{J}$ s is [[Plank’s Constant]].
