alias:: HDRP, 高清渲染管线

- #UnityRender
- The High Definition [[Render Pipeline]] is a prebuilt [[Scriptable Render Pipeline]]. HDRP lets you create cutting-edge, high-fidelity graphics for high-end platforms.
- [[HDRP]] uses [[physically-based lighting]] and [materials]([[physically-based material]]), and supports both [forward]([[forward rendering]]) and [[deferred rendering]]. HDRP uses [[compute shader]]  technology and therefore requires compatible GPU hardware.
- For information on how to use HDRP, see the [HDRP documentation microsite](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest).
