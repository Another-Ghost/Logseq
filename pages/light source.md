alias:: light sources

- [[Light waves]] are emitted when the [[electric charges]] in an object [[oscillate]]. Part of the energy that caused the oscillations—heat, electrical energy, chemical energy—is converted to [[light energy]], which is *radiated* away from the object. In rendering, such objects are treated as [[light sources]].
