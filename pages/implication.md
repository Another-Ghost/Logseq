- # Definition
	- Let $p$ and $q$ be [[propositions]]. The proposition "$p$
	  implies $q$" denoted by $p\rightarrow q$ is called [[implication]]. It is $false$
	  when $p$ is $true$ and $q$ is $false$ and is $true$ otherwise.
	- In $p\rightarrow q$, $p$ is called the [[hypothesis]] and $q$ is called the [[conclusion]].

- $p\rightarrow q$ is read in a variety of equivalent ways:
	- if $p$ then $q$
	- $p$ only if $q$
	- $p$ is sufficient for $q$
	- $q$ whenever $p$
