  id:: 645ceee1-6e8a-48f1-b0b9-24aee92135c9
	- There exists an [[ordered field]] $R$ which has the [[least-upper-bound property]].
	  id:: 644503fd-d322-4bfe-bb41-887809872124
	- Moreover, $R$ contains $Q$ ([[rational]]) as a [[subfield]].
- # Theorem
	- (a)  [[archimedean property]]: If $x\in R$, $y\in R$, and $x>0$, then there is a positive [[integer]] $n$ such that $nx > y$.
	- (b) If $x\in R$, $y\in R$, and $x < y$, then there exists a $p\in Q$ such that $x< p<y$.
		- may be stated by saying that $Q$ is [[dense]] in $R$: Between any two real numbers there is a [[rational]] one.
	- (c) For every [[real]] $x > 0$ and every [[integer]] $n > 0$ there is **one and only one** positive real $y$ such that $y^n = x$.
		- This number $y$ is written $\sqrt[n]{x}$ or $x^{1/n}$.
