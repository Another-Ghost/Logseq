- #RenderingPipelineStage
- The information for each *pixel* is stored in the [[color buffer]], which is a *rectangular array* of [[colors]]. It is the responsibility of the [[merging stage]] to combine the *fragment color* produced by the [[pixel shading stage]] with the *color* currently stored in the *buffer*.
  Unlike the [[pixel shading stage]], the *GPU subunit* that performs this stage is typically **not fully programmable**. However, it is highly configurable, enabling various effects.
- ## VIsibility and z-buffer
	- This stage is also responsible for resolving [[visibility]]. 
	  This means that when the whole scene has been rendered, the [[color buffer]] should contain the *colors* of the *primitives* in the scene that are [[visible]] from the [[point of view]] of the [[camera]]. 
	  For most or even all *graphics hardware*, this is done with the [[z-buffer]] *algorithm*.
- ## Stencil Buffer
	- The [[stencil buffer]] is an [[offscreen buffer]] used to *record* the *locations* of the rendered primitive. 
	  It typically contains $8$ *bits* per pixel. 
	  Primitives can be rendered into the [[stencil buffer]] using various functions, and the *buffer*â€™s contents can then be used to **control rendering into the [[color buffer]] and [[z-buffer]]**.
	- > As an example, assume that a filled circle has been drawn into the stencil buffer. This can be combined with an operator that allows rendering of subsequent primitives into the color buffer only where the circle is present. The stencil buffer can be a powerful tool for generating some special effects.
- All these functions at the end of the *pipeline* are called [[raster operations]] or [[blend operations]]. 
  As mentioned, [[blending]] is typically *configurable* using the *API* and not *fully programmable*.
  However, some *APIs* have support for [[raster order views]], also called [[pixel shader ordering]], which enable *programmable blending* capabilities.
- ## Framebuffer
	- The [[framebuffer]] generally consists of all the [[buffers]] on a system.
	- ### Double Buffering
		- The screen displays the contents of the [[color buffer]]. To avoid allowing the human viewer to see the primitives as they are **being rasterized and sent to the screen**, [[double buffering]] is used. This means that the rendering of a scene **takes place** off screen, in a [[back buffer]].
		  Once the scene has been rendered in the [[back buffer]], the contents of the *back buffer* are **swapped with** the contents of the [[front buffer]] that was previously displayed on the screen. 
		  The *swapping* often occurs during [[vertical retrace]], a time when it is safe to do so.
