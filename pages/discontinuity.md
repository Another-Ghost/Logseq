- # Definition
	- If $x$ is a **point** in the [[domain of definition]] of the [[function]] $f$ at which $f$ is not [[continuous]], we say that $f$ is [[discontinuous]] at $x$, or that $f$ has a [[discontinuity]] at $x$.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Let $f$ be defined on $(a, b)$. If $f$ is [[discontinuous]] at a point $x$, and if $f(x+)$([[right-hand limit]]) and $f(x-)$ exist, then $f$ is said to have a [[discontinuity of the first kind]] at $x$, there are two ways:
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- $f(x+)\ne f(x-)$ ([[jump discontinuity]]);
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- $f(x +) = f(x - ) \ne f(x)$ ([[removable discontinuity]]).
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Otherwise the discontinuity is said to be of the [[discontinuity of second kind]].
