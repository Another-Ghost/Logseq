- The [[enclosure]], [[aperture]], and [[lens]] have the combined effect of causing the [[sensors]] to be [[directionally specific]]. They average light over a small area and a small set of incoming directions. Rather than measuring **average** [[irradiance]] quantifies the surface density of light flow from all directions, these sensors measure **average** [[radiance]], which quantifies the brightness and color of a single ray of light.

- The lens has an additional effect aside from limiting the [[depth of field]]. Each sensor location receives a cone of light rays, even for points that are in perfect focus. 
  The idealized model where each shading sample represents a single viewing ray can sometimes introduce [[mathematical singularities]], [[numerical instabilities]], or [[visual aliasing]].
  Keeping the physical model in mind when we render images can help us identify and resolve such issues.
