# Definition
	- For any [[real]] $c$, the **set** of real numbers $x$ such that $x > c$ is called a [[neighborhood]] of $+\infty$ and is written $(c, +\infty)$. Similarly, the set $(-\infty, c)$ is a **neighborhood** of $-\infty$.

	- Let $f$ be a [[real]] function defined on $E\subset R$. We say that  $f(t)\to A$ as $t\to x$, where $A$ and $x$ are in the [[extended real number system]], if for every [[neighborhood]] $U$ of $A$ there is a **neighborhood** $V$ of $x$ such that $V\cap E$ is **not empty**, and such that $f(t)\in U$ for all $t\in V\cap E, t \ne x$.

	  >If $A$ is $\infty$, this [[limit]] is called a [[infinite limit]];
	  If $x$ is $\infty$, this [[limit]] is called a [[limit at infinity]].
	- Let $f$ and $g4 be defined on $E\subset R$. Suppose $f(t)\to A, g(t)\to B$ as $t\to x$,
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	  Then
		- $f(t)\to A'$ implies $A'=A$ (**uniqueness**);
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- $(f + g)(t) \to A+B$;
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- $(fg)(t)\to A B$;
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- $(f /g)(t)\to\frac{A}{B}$,
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- provided the right members of (b), (c), and (d) are defined.
