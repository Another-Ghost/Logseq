alias:: 辐射率

- [[radiance]] is a measure of electromagnetic radiation in a *single ray*.
- [[Irradiance]] per [[solid angle]].
- [[radiant intensity]] per unit  [[projected area]].
- In shading equations, *radiance*  often appears in the form $L_o(\bold x, \bold d)$ or $L_i(\bold x, \bold d)$, which mean [[radiance]] going out from the point $\bold x$ or entering into it, respectively. The direction vector $\bold d$ indicates the *ray’s direction*, which by convention always **points away from** $\bold x$ .
- > $L$ 的值等价于[[标准光照模型]]中的[[shading color]] .
- The [[radiance]] in an environment can be thought of as a function of $5$ variables
  (or $6$, including [[wavelength]]), called the [[radiance distribution]].
  $3$ of the variables specify a [[location]], the other $2$ a [[direction]].
- Radiance is the final quantity computed by the [[rendering]] process.
