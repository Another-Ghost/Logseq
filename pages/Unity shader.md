- In [[Unity]], [shaders]([[Unity shader]]) are divided into $3$ broad categories:
	- [[Shaders]] that are part of the [[graphics pipeline]] are the most common type of shader. 
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	  In *Unity*, you usually work with this type of *shader* by using [[Shader objects]].
	- [[Compute shaders] perform *calculations* on the *GPU*, outside of the regular *graphics pipeline*.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- [[ray tracing shaders]] perform calculations related to [[ray tracing]].
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
