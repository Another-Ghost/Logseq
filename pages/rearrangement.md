# Definition
Let $\{k_n\}, n = 1, 2, 3, \cdots$, be a [[sequence]] in which every positive integer appears *once and only once* (that is $\{k_n\}$ is a [[1-1]] [[function]] form $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$). Putting 
$$a_n^{'} = a_{k_n},\ (n=1,2,3, ... )$$ 
we say that $\sum a_n^{'}$ is a [[rearrangement]] of $\sum a_n$.
- # Theorem
	- Let $\sum a_n$ be a series of [[real numbers]] which [[converges]], but **not**
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	  [[converge absolutely]] . Suppose
	  $$-\infty\leq\alpha\leq\beta\leq\infty$$
	  Then there exists a **rearrangement** $\sum a_n^{'}$ with **partial sums** $s_n^{'}$ such that
	  \begin{array}{c}
	  \liminf_{n\to\infty}s_n^{'}=\alpha \\
	  \limsup_{n\to\infty}s_n^{'}=\beta
	  \end{array}
	- If $\sum{a_n}$ is a series of [[complex numbers]] which [[converges absolutely]],
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	  then every **rearrangement** of $\sum a_n$ [[converges]], and they all converge to the **same sum**.
