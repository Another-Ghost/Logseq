alias:: 散射, scattered, scattered light wave, scattered wave, scattered waves, scatter

- After [[light waves]] have been emitted, they travel through space until they encounter some bit of *matter* with which to interact.
  The [[oscillating electrical field]] pushes and pulls at the [[electrical charges]] in the matter, causing them to [[oscillate]] in turn. The oscillating charges emit new light waves, which *redirect* some of the energy of the incoming light wave in new directions. This reaction, called [[scattering]], is the basis of a wide variety of optical phenomena.
- In rendering, A [[scattered light wave]] has the **same** [[frequency]] as the original wave. 
  >When, as is usually the case, the original wave contains **multiple frequencies** of light, each one
  **interacts with matter separately**. 
  Incoming light energy at one frequency **does not contribute to** emitted light energy at a different frequency.
- **More** light is scattered in directions **close to the original axis of propagation**, both forward and backward.
- The [[molecule]]’s effectiveness as a [[scatterer]]—the chance that a light wave in its vicinity will be scattered **at all**—varies strongly by [[wavelength]]. *Short-wavelength* light is scattered much **more effectively** than *longer-wavelength* light.
- > In rendering we are concerned with collections of **many molecules**. Light interactions with such aggregates will not necessarily resemble interactions with isolated molecules. Waves scattered from nearby molecules are often mutually coherent, and thus exhibit interference, since they originate from the same incoming wave.
