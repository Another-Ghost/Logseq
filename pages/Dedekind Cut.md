- {{embed ((645ceee1-6e8a-48f1-b0b9-24aee92135c9))}} will be proved in this by constructing $R$ from $Q$. We shall divide the construction into several steps.
- ## Step 1
	- The members of $R$ will be certain [[subsets]] of $Q$, called [[cuts]]. A cut is, by definition, any set $\alpha\subset Q$ with the following three properties.
		- (I) $\alpha\ne \emptyset$, and $\alpha\ne Q$.
		- (II) If $p\in\alpha, q\in Q$, and $q<p$, then $q\in\alpha$.
		- (III) If $p\in\alpha$, then $p < r$ for some $r\in\alpha$.
