alias:: 均匀介质

- [[homogeneous medium]] is a *volume* filled with *uniformly spaced identical [[molecules]]*.
- In a [[homogeneous medium]], the [[scattered waves]] are lined up so that they [[interfere destructively]] in all directions except for the original [[direction of propagation]]. 
  The final result is the **same** as the original wave, except for its [[phase velocity]] （光在不同介质中速度是不同的） and (in some cases) [[amplitude]]. 
  The final wave **does not exhibit any** [[scattering]]—it has effectively been suppressed by [[destructive interference]] ([[均匀介质]]中[[散射]]光中只有沿[[传播方向]]的部分没有被[[相消干涉]]，成为了[[折射]]光).
- ## Refraction and Absorption
	- The *ratio* of the [[phase velocities]] of the original and new waves defines an optical property of the [[medium]] called the [[index of refraction]], denoted by $n$.
	- Some media are [[absorptive]]. They convert part of the [[light energy]] to heat, causing the [[wave amplitude]] to decrease exponentially with [[distance]].
	  The rate of decrease is defined by the [[attenuation index]], denoted by $\kappa$ ([[kappa]]).
	- Both $n$ and $κ$ typically vary by [[wavelength]]. 
	  Together, these two numbers fully define **how the [[medium]] affects light of a given [[wavelength]]**, and they are often combined into a single complex number $n + iκ$, called the [[complex index of refraction]].
- ## Scattering and Absorption
	- [[不均匀介质]]会发生散射。
	  [[Scattering]] and [[absorption]] are both [[scale-dependent]].
	  In the general case, a [[medium’s appearance]] is caused by some **combination** of [[scattering]] and [[absorption]], as shown in figure.

	  The degree of [[scattering]] determines [[cloudiness]].
	  With somewhat rare exceptions, particles in [[solid]] and [[liquid]] media tend to be **larger** than a [[light wavelength]], and tend to [[scatter]] light of all [[visible wavelengths]] **equally**. 
	  Thus any [[color]] tint is usually caused by the [[wavelength dependence]] of the [[absorption]].
	  >A [[white color]] in particular is the result of a combination of *high scattering* and *low absorption*.
