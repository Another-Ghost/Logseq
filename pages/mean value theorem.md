- [[Rolle's theorem]]
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
  If $f$ is a [[continuous]] [[real]] function on $[a, b]$ which  are [[differentiable]] in $(a, b)$ and $f(a)=f(b)$, then there is a point $c\in(a,b)$ at which $f'(c) = 0$.
- [[Cauchy mean value theorem]]
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
  If $f$ and $g$ are [[continuous]] [[real]] functions on $[a, b]$ which are
  [[differentiable]] in $(a, b)$, then there is a point $c\in (a, b)$ at which
  $$[f(b) - f(a)]g'(c) = [g(b) - g(a)]f'(c)$$
  Note that [[differentiability]] is not required at the [[endpoints]].
- [[Lagrange mean value theorem]]
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
  If $f$ is a [[continuous]] [[real]] function on $[a, b]$ which is [[differentiable]] in $(a, b)$, then there is a point $c\in (a, b)$ at which 
  $$f(b) - f(a) = (b - a)f'(c)$$
