alias:: 有序集, 有序集合

- # Definition
	- An [[ordered set]] is a [[set]] $S$ in which an [[order]] is defined.
- # Theorem
- Suppose $S$ is an ordered set with the [[least-upper-bound property]], $B\in S$, $B$ is not empty, and $B$ is [[bounded below]]. Let $L$ be the set of all [[lower
  bound]]s of $B$. Then
  $$\alpha= \mathrm{sup}\ L$$
  exists in $S$, and $\alpha = \mathrm{inf}\ B$.
  In particular, $\mathrm{inf}\ B$ exists in $S$.
