alias:: 偏序关系, 偏序, partial order, partial,

- # Definition
	- Let $S$ be a [[set]], In general, by an [[partial order]] on $S$ we mean a [[relation]], denoted by $\le$, with the following three properties:
		- (i) $\le$ is [[reflexive]], that is, for all $x\in S, x≤x$.
		- (ii) $\le$ is [[antisymmetric]]. that is. for all $x, y\in s$, if $x≤y$ and $y≤x$, then $x=y$.
		- (iii) $≤$ is [[transitive]], that is, for all $x, y, z\in s$, if $x\le y$ and $y\le z$. then $x≤z$.
	- $<S, \leq>$ is called [[partial order set]].
