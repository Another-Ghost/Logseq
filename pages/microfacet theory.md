- Many [[BRDF models]] are based on a mathematical analysis of the effects of [[microgeometry]] on [[reflectance]] called [[microfacet theory]].
- The theory is based on the modeling of [[microgeometry]] as a **collection** of [[microfacets]].
- Each of [[microfacets]] is [[flat]], with a single [[microfacet normal]] $\bold m$. 
  The microfacets **individually** [[reflect]] light according to the [[micro-BRDF]] $fÂµ(\bold l, \bold v, \bold m)$, with the combined [[reflectance]] across all the [[microfacets]] **adding up** to the **overall surface BRDF**.
