- # Definition
- Let $X$ be a [[metric space]], $E\subset X$,
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
  $E$ is [[bounded]] if there is a [[real number]] $M$ and a [[point]] $q\in X$ such that $d(p, q) < M,\forall p\in E$.
- The [[sequence]] $\{p_n\}$ is said to be [[bounded]] if its [[range]]$\{p_n|n\in N\}$ is bounded.

- A [[mapping]] $f$ of a set $E$ into $R_k$ is said to be [[bounded]] if there is a [[real number]] $M$ such that $\left|f(x)\right|\le M$ for all $x\in E$.
